  Scenario: The system has a preferential parking space available on another sector web    # ParkingSpaceSuggestion.feature:127
    Given I signed up as "lils" with preference for parking spaces in the "Ã�rea II" sector # ParkingSpaceSuggestionSteps.groovy:20
    And the preferential parking space "16" is from the "CIn" sector                       # ParkingSpaceSuggestionSteps.groovy:49
    And the parking space "16" is available                                                # ParkingSpaceSuggestionSteps.groovy:53
    When I go to parking space's suggestion page                                           # ParkingSpaceSuggestionSteps.groovy:64
    And I select the filter from parking spaces in my preferred sector                     # ParkingSpaceSuggestionSteps.groovy:70
    And I select the filter from preferential parking spaces                               # ParkingSpaceSuggestionSteps.groovy:76
    And I confirm the filter options                                                       # ParkingSpaceSuggestionSteps.groovy:82
    Then I can not see the parking space "16" in the suggestions                           # ParkingSpaceSuggestionSteps.groovy:134
